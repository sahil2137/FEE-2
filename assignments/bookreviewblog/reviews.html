                            <h3>pride and prejudice</h3>
                            <p>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is my favorite book of all time-- which isn't a phrase I throw out lightly! This book truly has the best of all worlds-- a wonderful romance, lovable characters, humor, and beautiful writing. Pride and Prejudice is the story of a young woman in the 1800's, Elizabeth Bennet. The Bennet family has five daughters, and in an age where the only thing women could do was marry rich, all the girls are pressured to find wealthy matches to secure the family's comfort. Elizabeth, however, refuses to marry the first man the comes along, and only marry when for love. She meets brooding, silent, proud and very rich Mr. Darcy, who at first has no interest in Elizabeth. Over time, he begins to fall in love with her wit and charm. Elizabeth thinks Darcy is the last man she could ever marry, but through the course of the novel, begins to see that her prejudices towards him are fake and that he is a true gentleman who is only shy. The questions remains-- will they overcome their pride and prejudices and get married? I'm not a huge fan of 'classical classics' where the writing style is dull and hard to understand. I was so pleased to find that this is not the case with Austen's writing style. I enjoyed every single page of this wonderful novel, and truly did not want it to end! I will certainly be reading more Austen! I would recommend this book to anyone-- fans of romance, family-oriented stories, comedies, fans of classics, and even reluctant readers of classics who would like an easy gateway into the world of classic novels.

                            <h3>from blood and ash</h3>
                            <p>While FBAA isn’t anything unique or exceptionally amazing, it ticked all the right boxes for me at the right time. I love the story and the world, and I managed to connect to Poppy and Hawke. They are just the type of characters I love, and I am very happy that I decided to pick the book up.


                                I love the character dynamics and I especially love Hawke and Poppy as individual characters and as a couple. I love how respectful Hawke is to her and how he always thinks of what is best for her.
                                
                                
                                Poppy is a strong character who has been through a lot, but she doesn’t bow her head because of it, and I love it. It has been such a long time since I managed to connect with and care for new characters.
                                
                                Now that I’ve read all three of the books that are out, I can say for sure that the plot in the first book is definitely the most cliché one of the three and also the simplest one. However, the enjoyability of it was still top-notch for me.
                                
                                I have been told that the novel might be a bit slow in the beginning and I can see that. It takes it about 100 to 150 pages to set up everything and for the actual plot to begin, but I was engrossed the whole time. The author does a great job at setting up the story and introducing the characters.
                                
                                While some worlds in the paranormal romance sub-genre aren’t the most elaborate or original, I’d say this one is unique in its own way and quite dark. In this specific novel we see only one part of it, Solis. We see it through the eyes of Poppy who’s grown up in Solis and in a way, she represents all of the people in that kingdom since she has the same opinions and views as them, and we also see it through the eyes of outsiders who are helping Poppy break out of the box she’s been forced in. I absolutely loved that.
                                
                                
                                The end of FBAA was quite unexpected mostly because of the formatting of the book. I read the last line and kept on reading, only to realise that it started listing off the author’s previous works. It was quite a shock, to say the least.
